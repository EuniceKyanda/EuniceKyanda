## Hello there, I'm Eunice Kyanda👋

I am an Economics and Business student with a strong interest in how economic theory explains real-world social and financial behavior, markets, and global systems. I view economics as a way to interpret current events by combining quantitative analysis with social and institutional context to understand how resources are allocated and decisions are made.

My academic interests include behavioral and financial economics—where psychology, data, and markets intersect—as well as international trade, particularly how incentives, policy frameworks, and market structures influence cross-border outcomes.

I am drawn to work that blends economic analysis, research, and practical application, whether in consulting, finance, trade, business strategy, or entrepreneurial environments. I value critical thinking, evidence-based decision-making, and understanding the broader context behind economic outcomes.
